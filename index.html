                    <h2>Coastal Erosion</h2>
                    <article id="brief-desc">
                        Coastal erosion is the process through which rocks, sediments, and sands near the coastline may
                        be eroded or transported away. Local sea level rise, substantial wave action, and coastal floods
                        all contribute to coastal erosion. Storms and other natural occurrences may cause erosion along
                        any coastline; however, the most destructive circumstances are produced when a storm surge at
                        high tide is paired with the impacts of heavy waves. These circumstances are often linked with
                        tropical storms that reach landfall. As a consequence of the rise in global sea level, the
                        breadth and severity of the problem are worsening, but since the situation varies throughout the
                        country, there is no solution that is applicable everywhere.

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCoastal Erosion is a rather slow process that may take
                    hundreds of years, but researchers believe
                    that climate change is speeding up the process significantly. As a direct consequence of climate
                    change, the sea level has increased, as have the frequency and severity of storms, both of which are
                    substantial contributors to erosion. In reality, the Environment Agency of the United Kingdom has
                    estimated that the coastline of the United Kingdom might erode between 67 and 175 meters (or 220 and
                    580 feet) during the next century.

                    &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe ocean is now destroying the coastlines of a great number
                    of Philippine places, most of which are
                    coastal. Human activities, such as the destruction of coral reefs, are also to blame for the
                    problem, in addition to natural forces such as wind and waves. It is projected that the breadth of
                    this problem, as well as the impact it has, would extend as a result of climate change and the rise
                    in sea level. It is also projected that ongoing urbanization and the construction of additional
                    coastal villages will contribute to the problem's worsening.

                    <p>
                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAccording to the Research of Bautista et al. (2020), The
                        Philippines, an archipelagic nation with a coastline of at least 36,000 kilometers, has been
                        classified as including more than twenty locations at danger of coastal erosion. One of these
                        places, which is situated in Ibajay, Aklan, was subject to an examination. A three-dimensional
                        numerical model was developed in order to simulate and assess the existing hydrodynamics as well
                        as the silt flow. Using continuous data on water level and velocity collected from sensors
                        deployed in two independent field surveys, the correctness of the model was ensured. The
                        findings of the model are highly congruent with the actual data and properly represent the
                        tide-dominated hydrodynamics of the investigated region. By simulating flows under flood-ebb,
                        spring-nap, southwest-northeast monsoon, and 2-year circumstances, the temporal variability of
                        the hydrodynamics and transport of sediments was examined. Using the findings of the long-term
                        simulation, the locations of places that suffered erosion and deposition were determined. Except
                        for the region along the stream where local erosion and deposition processes occur, none of
                        these zones were situated along the coastline. On the basis of this information, it is possible
                        to conclude that the coastline in issue is safe given the current tide conditions. The collected
                        findings may be utilized as baseline data for guiding the municipality's future coastal
                        development, and the approach employed in this study can be extended to other erosion-prone
                        beaches in the United States.

                    <h3><b>Importance of a Hazard Map</b></h3>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAssessments of hazards and risks are the essential first
                        step in disaster risk management (DRM) and the foundation for developing DRM policy. They must
                        consider worst-case scenarios in the event of the greatest conceivable danger, while
                        acknowledging that hazard evaluations of earthquakes and tsunamis will always have limits and
                        related uncertainties. The purpose of hazard maps should be to advise and promote rapid
                        evacuation. They should be easily accessible and simple to comprehend. Primarily, they are
                        constructed to resist any calamities. Hazard maps are tools that, when utilized correctly by
                        planners, developers, and engineers, may save lives and save economic losses by preventing
                        exposure to certain dangers and designing other projects to mitigate or eliminate the possible
                        adverse effects of these hazards.
